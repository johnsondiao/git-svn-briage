# git-svn-briage

DO NOT USE this tool.

This tool is under very very early develop.

I need to test the case blew:

1.dg -s : the svn repo has new file added

2.dg -s : the svn repo delete files

3.dg -s : the svn repo has new folder added

4.dg -s : the svn repo delete folders

5.dg -p : local workspace add new files

6.dg -p : local workspace delete new files

7.dg -p : local workspace add new folders

8.dg -p : local workspace delete folders

9.dg -s and dg -p : svn command failed at any steps

10.combine the -p and -s function

11.write a better readme
